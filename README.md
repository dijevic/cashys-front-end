<h3 color="red" align="center">A React app to keep on track my debts and incomes </h3>

 <br/>

 <p>the idea of the project was to create a complete MERN stack development to deal with incomes and debts , having a balance of them and be able to do a CRUD of operations(debts and incomes) and categories</p>

The project has been done with _React_ & _zustand(global state)_ , _React Router v6_ , _Styled components_ and _react-toastify_

To deal with the global state I am using **zustand** which is less weight than **React-Redux & Redux** , and really easy to setup and use.
For the App routing and using React-router v6 which is the latest known version of React-Router.

For the styles I decide to del with them using **Styled components**(and no regrets are coming to me, this is for me the best way to style components while possible) and the beauty and easy to use **react-toastify** to work with the notifications and messages.

Overall I tried to be as atomic as possible with my components, always trying to keep the components simples and easy to read.
